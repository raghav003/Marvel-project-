Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an upcoming sequel to the Marvel Cinematic 
Universe film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It was confirmed in April 2017, by 
James Gunn who will return to write and direct the third film.In November 2014, Gunn stated that, in addition to having the "basic story" for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.[2] Despite this, Gunn stated in June 2015 that he was unsure if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[3] In April 2016, Feige said on future MCU films, "it is still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say Guardians 3 is [one film that's] up there. I don't know what exactly the order will be."[4] In March 2017, Gunn stated there would be a third film "for sure. We're trying to figure it out,"[5] also adding, "There are no specific plans for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. But we know unless something goes horribly — which is always possibly, you never know — I think that Marvel would want to make another movie."[6] He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the film and that he was going to figure 
out his involvement and his next project "over the next couple of weeks."The 
following month, Gunn announced he would return to write and direct Guardians of 
the Galaxy Vol. 3.
